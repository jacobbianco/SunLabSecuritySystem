# SunLabSecuritySystem
The program begins at a login screen. The user must enter their 9 digit ID to proceed to the student view if they are a student,or the administrator view if they are an administrator/professor. The student view contains an oppurtunity for the student to "swipe" their
ID card to enter the Sun Lab (User must type a string like %A123456789 to swipe. The 9 digit number is their ID). They must also select if they are entering or leaving the Sun Lab. The administrator view allows the user to view all users stored in the database, and 
enable/disable their access to the Sun Lab. They can also view all time logs of users that entered or exited the Sun Lab, and filter this list by ID, date, or date and time. Watch the video demo at this link: https://youtu.be/odtnAGuKilo .
